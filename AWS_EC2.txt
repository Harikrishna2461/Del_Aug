LAUNCHING AN EC2 INSTANCE:

Mail AWS Link : https://ravind.signin.aws.amazon.com/console 
Mail Username : DLTAIBCB2A06@ravinsofttech.com
Mail Password :  welSur99
IP Address Checking Link (Just For Reference) : https://whatismyipaddress.com

1.Create a Local Folder to save the ppk/ppm files --> Go to AWS Webiste Using the Link in Mail and Provide credentials given in Mail --> EC2 --> Then Region is N.Virginia
   (For the purpose of this training).
   Normally if it is not deloitte machine,you can go to AWS,then create account,then login before creating the EC2 Instance.
2.Launch Instance(Yellowish Orange Button)
3.Go to Name and tags then give a Name and then choose the macgine/instance as Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM)(the 2nd one) or any other as per need.
   (We can specify the number of instances/machines needed also here).
4.Create a new key pair and save the ppk/ppm file in a folder/use an existing key pair 
5.Create a new key pair/use an existing security group --> In side click Launch Button
6.Right click the instance and copy public key.
7.(1)Go to putty gen in windows if you just have the ppm file or ppk file,then click file then load private key,
       browse the file and select the ppk file,the click save private key and save the key file. 
    (2)Alternatively in latest version,we can directly download the ppk file(in step-4),thus not needing to use putty-gen at all and
       directly go to putty to configure your instance with the directly downloaded ppk file.
8.Go to putty configuration/putty in windows and then copy paste the public id from instances in the
  host name,don't change host port,then got to ssh --> auth --> Credentials --. Browse the ppk file and click open.
  then in terminal then type and click ec2-user and the message will say "Authenticating with public key 'key_name'".
9.Alternate is go to the folder containing the ppk file in laptop --> Get bash here --> type :
  ssh -i hari_ec2_1.pem ec2-user@44.211.26.104 (ssh -i key-pair-filename.pem ec2-user@public_id 
  (get public id by right clicking the instance)).If both methods dont work then just terminate this and start a new instance.
10.Type Date to check if its working.


SECURITY:

1.go to instances --> then lick on an instance's security group name --> select security from instances page 
  and right click the Security groups and open in new browser --> Then we can edit the security rules under 
  inbound rules --> select a rule and then --> edit inbound rules to edit.
2.you can change 'source(info)'(under the edit rules) to 'My IP' (if needed change the ip to your ip,example:'42:46:48:00'
  and the click save rules.This is done so that even if someone else has your ppk file,he won't be able to access your instances,
  otherwise if it is open from anywhere,then anyone with your ppk file can access your instances.
3.Then run your putty configuration again (Otherwise if you go to putty and try to run something it will say connection timed out(error)).
4. You can also add port type as SSH or HTTP or HTTPS etc..


User Data Script --> httpd

Now Excecute these commands in Putty after you go to the Putty terminal to run an example html file:

COMMANDS:
1.sudo yum update -y
2.sudo yum install httpd -y
3.sudo systemctl start httpd
4.sudo systemctl enable httpd
5.sudo chmod 777 -R /var/www/html/
6.echo '<h1>Hello Hari!How are you?</h1>' > /var/www/html/index.html (index.html is the default home page of a website)
7.Use ll to see the file and to see the contents use 'cat /var/www/html/index.html'.
8.To view in the browser type public_id:http_port(example 80) to view this page in browser.If port is not configured,you should go to the security group,then click on type,
   then choose http and choose port number as 80 or any other number then click save.

USING USER DATA WITHOUT TYPING COMMANDS IN PUTTY TERMINAL (ALternative Way) :
1.Create a new instance , give it a new name,then select the security groups and key-pairs.Then go to advanced options,then upload the file which you want or you can directly 
   go to the space below and then copy the 'COMMNDS' above in the space below the 'upload files' button and then click launch instance.(The commands are the instructions script).
2.Commands shoul be copied like this:
     #!/bin/bash
     All the other 6 Commands
3.Then go to the browser and give the respective public_id:port to check if the process was successful.
4.If the putty config throws an error,the just terminate this instance,create a new instance,then create a new .ppm/.ppk key file,configure .ppm using putty-gen if needed
   and then modify its rules to have both http and ssh,then go to putty terminal and type and enter ec2-user/any other user name.
